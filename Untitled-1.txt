primitive data types
1>string :use double coat,singal coat, backtick
var str="hi';
    name   value


    interpolation->${} allowing embedded expression

    template liter are string literals allowimg embedded expression you can use multi-line string and string interpolation features with them they were called "template 
    string" in prior editions of the es2015 specification

    syntax 
    `string text`
    `string text line1
    string text line2`

    `string text ${expression} string text`
    tag `string text ${expression} string text`

    js 3 types of quotes
    1>double quotes:"hello"
    2>single quotes:'hello'
    3>backticks:`hello'

    backticks are extended functionality quotes they allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${..}

    let name="john";
    //embedded a variables
    alert(`hello , ${name}!);
    the expression inside ${...}is evaluated and the result becomes a part of the string.we can put anything there a variable like name or an arthmatical expression
    like 1+2 or something more complex                              
  checking datatype use typeof


  Number Data type
  var n=123;
  n=12.345;

  the number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

  there are many operation for numbers
  e.g multipication * ,division /, addition +, subbstraction - and so on; 

  infinity represents the mathematical infinity .
  it is a special value that's greater than any number.
  we can get it as a result of division by zero
  alert(1/0); //infinity
  alert(infinity);//infinity
  NaN represents a computational error.it is result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation,for instance
  alert("not a number"/2); //NaN, such division is erroneous NaN is sticky
  any further operation on Nan Returns NaN
  alert("not a number"/2+5); //NaN
  sp if there's a NaN somewhere in a mathematical expression,it propagates to the whole result 
  let is keyword to declare a variable


Array in Javascript
in Javascript,array is a single variable that is used to store different elements..
in js array is a single variable that stores multiple elements.

the js array object is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays;which are high-level,list like objects
 
 create an array
 var fruits = ['apple','banan'];
 console.log(fruits.length);
 <ESLint prettier> java script coding conventional tools



The array.of() method creates a new array instance from a variable number of arguments,regardless
of number or type of the arguments

syntax
Array.of(element0[,element1[,...[',elementN]]])

The difference btn Array.of and the array constructor is in the handling of integer arguments: Array.of(7) creates an array with a single elements,7 whereas
 array(7) creates an empty array with a length
 Array.of(7);  //[7]
 Array.of(1,2,3); //[1,2,3]
 Array(1,2,3); //[1,2,3]


The Array.isArray()
method determnes whether the passed value is an array.

syntax
Array.isArray(value)
Array.isArray([1,2,3]); //true
Array.isArray({foo:123}); //false
Array.isArray('foobar'); //false
Array.isArray(undefined); //false
if the value is an array,true is returned,otherwise false is returned
