 functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in javascript.A function is a javascript procedure-a set of statements that 
 performs a task or calculates a value.
 to use a function,you must
 define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.


 javascript function syntax 

 A javascript function is defined with the function keyword,followed by a name,followed by parantheses().
 function names can contain letters,digits,underscores,and dollar signs (same rules as variables)


 Anonymous functions

  Anonymous functions are functions that are dynamically declared at runtime.they're called Anonymous 
  functions because they arent given a name in the same way as normal functions.anonymous functions are 
  declared using the function operator instead of the function declaration


  function(){
      alert('');
  }

* function expression

A js function can also be defined using an expression.
A function expression can be stored in a variable:
After a function expression has been stored in a variable,the variable can be used as a function:

exp:var x = function(){
    console.log('hello x);
}

the function above is actually an anonymous function (a function without a name)

functions stored in variables do not need function names.
they are always
invoked (called) using the variable name.

//name : value
let users = function(){
    alert('hii);
};//called

users(); //calling function

anonymous function call that function immediately you getting error like uncaught syntaxerror:(this is local variable)

 iife

 data secure
 immediately invoking page


An IIFE (immediately Invoked Function Expression)
is a javascript function that runs as soon as it is defined .

(function(){
    statements
})();

why do we use IIFE?
the primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy.
because javascript's var scopes variables to their containing functions,any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world
